## The Competition:
This repo is my take on the competition

## What I used:
* Google Colab
* Python 3.8
* Python Packages: Pandas, Matplotlib
* Tableau

## What I did:
The plan was to look through the data and find relevant columns to find the best market to deploy the car share service.

Look at the notebook for the data cleaning: https://github.com/vbgupta/Deloitte-Datathon/blob/master/Deloitte.ipynb

## Solution:
![alt text](https://github.com/vbgupta/Deloitte-Datathon/blob/master/Deloitte_Tableau_Dashboard.JPG?raw=true)

* Denver has highest median travel time but they do not have the most number of cars.
* Denver also has the most number of taxi services which is currently beating the competition from Uber and Lyft.
* The rideshare app can be user friendly in Denver where the popualtion is relatively young compared to Miami and Portland.

Now the main question is well if taxis are dominating in Denver, then why are we favoring that. 
The plan is to deploy the rideshare service through the taxi services and riders. As they dominate, we can leverage the taxi share in Denver to get started.

So, Denver is the best market to deploy the rideshare service inaccordance to the given dataset!
